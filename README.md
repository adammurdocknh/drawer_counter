# Drawer Counter

Drawer Counter is a simple script I wrote for my little brother (My favorite brother Eli) in an afternoon. It is designed to speed up the process of counting your drawer when clocking out at a retail job. It takes the number of bills by denomination and returns that number and the numerical total of each denomination. It also returns the drawer total.

## Installation

Download or clone the script. This was written using `python3.9.0` and uses static type checking. As such you'll need `python3.7+`. No libraries were used.


```zsh
git clone https://github.com/adammurdocknh/drawer_counter.git
```



## Usage

```python
python drawer_counter.py
```
